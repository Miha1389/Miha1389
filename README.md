I am a dynamic and enthusiastic professional with a diverse background seeking a career that aligns with my skills and interests. I possess expertise in health and safety, customer service, client support, and training, along with a range of transferable skills that will contribute to my success in data management. My strong relationship management and service abilities empower me to build effective connections.

Recently, I had the opportunity to participate in an intensive eight-week boot camp focused on the fundamentals of a Data Technician or Analyst role. This experience was incredibly valuable as I am new to the industry, and I gained essential skills that have broadened my understanding of data management. Although my previous experience was in construction, where I developed abilities in landscaping, tiling, and painting, I view these skills as a solid foundation for adaptability and learning in a new field. I embrace challenges and am eager to explore new opportunities for growth to reach my objectives.

Skills: Python, Google Collab, Power BI, Tableau, Microsoft SQL and Azure.
