I am an enthusiastic professional with a diverse background, seeking a rewarding career in the data industry that aligns with my skills and interests.

Recently, I had the opportunity to participate in an intensive eight-week boot camp focused on the fundamentals of a Data Technician or Analyst role. This experience has been incredibly beneficial as I transition into the industry, equipping me with essential skills that enhance my understanding of data management. While my background is in constructionâ€”where I developed skills in landscaping, tiling, and paintingâ€”I see these experiences as a strong foundation for adaptability and growth in a new field. I welcome challenges and am motivated to explore new opportunities that will help me achieve my professional goals.

Skills: Python, Power BI, Azure, Tableau, Microsoft SQL, and Google Collab
