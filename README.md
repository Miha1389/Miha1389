I am a dynamic and enthusiastic professional with a diverse background seeking a career that aligns with my skills and interests. I possess expertise in health and safety, customer service, client support, and training, along with a range of transferable skills that will contribute to my success in data management. My strong relationship management and service abilities empower me to build effective connections.

Recently, I had the opportunity to participate in an intensive eight-week boot camp focused on the fundamentals of a Data Technician or Analyst role. This experience has been incredibly beneficial as I transition into the industry, equipping me with essential skills that enhance my understanding of data management. While my background is in constructionâ€”where I developed skills in landscaping, tiling, and paintingâ€”I see these experiences as a strong foundation for adaptability and growth in a new field. I welcome challenges and am motivated to explore new opportunities that will help me achieve my professional goals.

Skills: Python, Power BI, Azure, Tableau, Microsoft SQL, and Google Collab
